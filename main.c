/*
 * Assignment1.c
 * In a group of two, create a game in which two people compete on how fast they can light on their set of LEDs. Each user will be assigned a press button and his set of LEDs.
 * As a user presses the button his assigned LED will lit up one after the other. The person who switch on all his LEDs first wins.
 * The winner will be exposed by flashing their assigned LEDs for a while, before reseting the system for a new competation.
 * 
 * Your program should make use of arrays, functions, and for-loop. A report should be submitted here, and the hardware will be presented in the classroom.
